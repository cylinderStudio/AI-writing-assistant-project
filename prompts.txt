1. Training Data Generation Prompt

Please generate a supervised fine-tuning dataset of 30 examples in Alpaca-style instruction format that consists of samples from past, fictional Massive
Dynamic marketing docs, advertisements, social media posts, service and product descriptions, service and product user guides, presentations, TV and radio
scripts, and variations for perhaps different instructions for things like press releases, social media posts, or FAQs.

When creating this dataset, create unique entries with no repetition, and do not invent facts about Massive Dynamic that conflict with what you are aware of
from the "Fringe" television show and its mythology, including employee names, products and services, etc. I'm also attaching three documents here you can
use to supplement or confirm that information. It is acceptable to invent things like employee, division or product names if you are simply furthering the
mythology.

The tone and voice in these entries should reflect the following characteristics:

-Innovating and cutting-edge
-Confident and assured
-Optimistic and visionary
-Sleek and modern
-Underlying sense of mystery and intrigue, inviting curiosity about the company's true intentions and implications of its research

Here is an example of an entry you might create:

{
"instruction": "Create an internal memo for marketing staff about our upcoming aeronautics division product launch campaign.",
"input": "",
"output": "Team, as we prepare to unveil our revolutionary AeroSight Drone Fleet, let’s harness Massive Dynamic’s spirit of innovation and ambition.
Our campaign should highlight how AeroSight pushes the boundaries of modern flight—safer, smarter, and infinitely adaptable. We’ll showcase these
advancements across digital platforms, in-person demos, and exclusive press events. Let’s share Massive Dynamic’s optimism and visionary leadership with the
world, positioning AeroSight as the future of intelligent aeronautics."
}
Make sure the output for each example has details, length and features you would expect for the format. For example, Press releases should be three to five
paragraphs, have adequate detail, and feature datelines. Or as another example, commercial scripts should be long enough to fill the time you specify (30 or 60
seconds) and contain music, voiceover or visual cues.
